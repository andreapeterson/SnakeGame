# SnakeGame

Using OOP and class inheritance as well as the turtle library, I recreated the classic snake game with a few fun modifications. The goal of the game is to collect the circular "food" pieces to add segments to your snake and increase your score. I added a "snake-like" head and made each new piece a random, fun color. Also, every time you gain a new piece the speed of the snake increases (don't worry though, the increase is non-linear so after many pieces it won't get that much faster to make the gaming experience more enjoyable). It keeps score at the top, but beware not to run into yourself or the wall.
